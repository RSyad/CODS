# CODS
When the students run the Campus Online Delivery System (CODS), they will be greeted with  the word “WELCOME” and they need to key-in their <username>, <address> and <contact number>. Then,  the program will display “HELLO <USERNAME> HOW CAN CODS HELP YOU TODAY?”. After that, the user will be given a numbered category of food such as ‘RICE’, ‘NOODLES’, ‘WESTERN’ and ‘DRINKS’. The user will be prompted to enter the number of the category that they wish to choose.  Then, the program will show another interface which shows another numbered list of foods according to the category they have chosen. Besides the menu the price of the food is displayed in Ringgit Malaysia. After the user entered the number (not quantity) of the food they want to order, then they will be asked to enter the quantity of the said food they want to order. Next, the program will be taken back to the interface with the list of foods with the quantity of food they have ordered displayed. If the user wished to continue ordering, they can do so by repeating the previous steps. There will also be a back button if the user wished to return to the previous interface. If the user orders multiple items, the total price will be displayed.
